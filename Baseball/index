				<p>A source of distraction for me during this spring quarter is the start of baseball. There are many things I love about baseball and one of them is its history, its been around a long time. The earliest mention of baseball was in 1791 and the earliest team to play under modern rules was in 1845, the New York Knickerbockers. Professional baseball began in 1869 when the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) established a professional category.</p>
				<p>The video clip is of the 1918 Oakland Oaks opening day festivities (there is no sound). J Cal Ewing, pictured at the start of the clip - the white haired man standing alongside the car - was the owner of the Oaks and the San Francisco Seals in the early 20th century and a major influence in the Pacific Coast League (PCL). The PCL still exists, now as one of the AAA leagues for professional clubs. Until the 1940s, it was a premiere West Coast baseball league. The popularity of the PCL prompted the MLB and its owners to move clubs like the Giants and the Dodgers to California in the 1960s. The pitcher in the clip is actually a dancer "Doraldina" and the catcher is "Pop" Anson, part of the opening day festivities, 1918 style.</p>			
				<p>The audio clip is of Bobby Thomson's pennant-winning three run home run for the Giants in 1951. It was known as the "Shot Heard Round the World". Bobby Thomson was a Scottish-born outfielder who was known as "The Staten Island Scot".</p> 
				<p>Going to watch baseball, for me, is a special event. I'll always remember the first time I saw the field at Safeco, my first time in a professional ball park. I even go to the Kitsap BlueJackets games at the Fairgrounds. When you look in the stands you see all kinds, from infants to octogenarians, out for a beautiful day at the park.</p>
